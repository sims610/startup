[My Notes](notes.md)

This application serves as a way for couples and families to easily choose a baby name to give to their child soon to be.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown: *I learned how Markdown works and used it appropriately.*
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch: *I tried my best to come up with a compelling pitch for my intended audience.*
- [X] Description of key features: *Completed!*

### Elevator pitch

What's in a name? **Everything!** With such an important decision riding on soon-to-be parents, stress can be high. Especially when everyone and their dog has an opinion about which name is best. The Baby Namer simplifies that decision for couples and families in a fun and easy way. The Baby Namer allows couples to log in and flip through baby names on their phone, select the ones they like, and then see the ones both chose. Additionally, couples have the option of adding family members to also contribute in the naming process and choose the names they like. Finally, couples can hear the feedback from loved ones without offending someone because "no one chose great aunt Sally's favorite name." End the needless frustration of choosing a name and have some fun!

### Design

Here is the Design of the main page of my application.

This will be what it looks like as you choose names.

Here is a sequence diagram to illustrate how the backend will work when you accept or like a name.

```
