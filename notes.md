## AWS Notes

I learned some helpful things about getting an EC2 server from this lesson. I built my own EC2 and attached my own Elastic IP to it. Here are some important need to knows about that:

- Access my webserver through this ip:
  - `54.161.165.237`
- This is the general format to ssh into a server:
  - `ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]`
- Use whois to see who the owner of a web server is.

I also learned how to assign a domain name to your ip address. This was done through Route 53 on AWS. I learned how to Lease a domain name and did that with mine for a year.

## HTML Notes

There were several helpful things that I learned from this deliverable. First, that svg is really powerful and helpful. I had no idea that you could do so much with images and creating them. The rest was a lot of review, but still super helpful. I learned how to add inputs: `<input type=[type] id=[id] />`
