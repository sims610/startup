## AWS Notes

I learned some helpful things about getting an EC2 server from this lesson. I built my own EC2 and attached my own Elastic IP to it. Here are some important need to knows about that:

- Access my webserver through this ip:
  - 54.161.165.237
- This is the general format to ssh into a server:
  - ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
- Use whois to see who the owner of a web server is.

I also learned how to assign a domain name to your ip address. This was done through Route 53 on AWS. I learned how to Lease a domain name and did that with mine for a year.
